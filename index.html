				<h3>Causes</h3>
				<p>Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities, and forest fires are common sources of air pollution. Key pollutants of public health concern include particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. Smog, another form of air pollution, is exacerbated by increased heat and ultraviolet radiation during warmer weather. Additionally, fumes from paint, hair spray, varnish, aerosol sprays, and other solvents contribute to air pollution. Aviation also plays a significant role in contributing to air pollution.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="prosair">
				<h3>Preventions</h3>
				<p>Reducing gasoline consumption is essential for minimizing air pollution and combating climate change. Making smart transportation choices, such as walking, biking, or using public transportation, can significantly lower our carbon footprint. When driving is necessary, opting for fuel-efficient or electric vehicles can make a big difference. Additionally, exploring renewable energy options for your home, like wind or solar power, can further reduce your environmental impact. Supporting local food producers also helps cut down on the fossil fuels used in transporting goods over long distances. By adopting these practices, we can collectively work towards a cleaner, healthier planet.

<section class="third">
		<div class="water">
				<a name = "water" class="water"><h1>Water Pollution</h1></a>
				<p class="descw">Water pollution occurs when harmful substances, such as chemicals or microorganisms, contaminate bodies of water like streams, rivers, lakes, oceans, or aquifers. This contamination degrades the water quality, making it toxic to both humans and the environment. The presence of these pollutants can disrupt aquatic ecosystems, harm wildlife, and pose serious health risks to people who rely on these water sources for drinking, recreation, and other purposes. Addressing water pollution is essential for protecting public health and preserving the natural environment.



				</p>
				<div class="totalwater">
					<div class="proswater">
						<h3>Causes</h3>
						<p>Water is uniquely vulnerable to pollution due to its ability to dissolve more substances than any other liquid on Earth, earning it the title of a “universal solvent.” Water pollution typically stems from four main sources: sewage, industrial activities, agriculture, and urban runoff, including stormwater. For instance, discharging inadequately treated wastewater into natural water bodies can degrade aquatic ecosystems. Additionally, water pollution can cause water-borne diseases for people who use contaminated water for drinking, bathing, washing, or irrigation. Addressing these pollution sources is crucial for maintaining clean and safe water for all.</p>
					</div>
								
					<div class="proswater">
						<h3>Preventions</h3>
						<p>Preventing water pollution involves several practical steps that everyone can take. Start by reducing your plastic consumption and making an effort to reuse or recycle plastic items whenever possible. Proper disposal of chemical cleaners, oils, and nonbiodegradable items is crucial to prevent them from going down the drain and contaminating water sources. Regularly maintain your car to avoid leaks of oil, antifreeze, or coolant. Be cautious about what you pour into storm sewers, as this waste often goes untreated before entering local waterways. If you see a storm sewer blocked by litter, clean it up to prevent trash from polluting the water. Additionally, avoid applying fertilizer to your lawn right before it rains, as the chemicals can wash into storm drains and waterways. By adopting these practices, we can all contribute to cleaner and safer water for everyone.
						</p>
					</div>
								
					<div class="proswater">
						<h3>Facts</h3>
						<p>Approximately 785 million people worldwide lack access to clean drinking water due to pollution. Industrial activities contribute significantly to this issue, with around 70% of industrial waste being dumped into water bodies, polluting the usable water supply. Each year, industries discharge an estimated 300-400 million tonnes of polluted waste into water bodies, including millions of tonnes of heavy metals, solvents, toxic sludge, and other hazardous materials. Additionally, about 14 billion pounds of garbage, mostly plastic, are dumped into the ocean annually. This pollution has severe health consequences, leading to the deaths of approximately 15 million children under the age of five each year due to water-borne diseases. Addressing water pollution is crucial for ensuring safe drinking water and protecting public health.</p>
